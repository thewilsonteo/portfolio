							<p>Coffee bean trials are placed to entice the viewer and lead their eyes to scroll to the next page. And according to a demographic survey, it was shown that the café has a higher female following. Hence, female models were used.</p>
							<h3 class="major">Packaging Design</h3>
							<p>The café decided to expand its business beyond its storefront by selling their in-house coffee beans. A packaging mockup was created for this purpose.</p>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/cafency-coffee-bean-packaging-design-resized.jpg" alt="Café Coffee Bean Packaging" /></span>
							<p>At the top of the packaging is small, triangle hole which makes it easy to tear and open. There is also a resealable feature which help preserve the <b>quality and freshness</b> of the beans by sealing the bag after use. A smelling patch was also placed strategically on the middle of the spilt coffee beans for customers to smell the beans in order for them to make a more informed choice on the coffee beans they are purchasing.</p>
