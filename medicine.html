							<h3 class="major">App Design</h3>
							<span class="image"><img src="images/medeliver-medicine-app-mockup.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a medicine delivery app was proposed in order to minimise contact between patients with low risk ailments and hospitals being possible high risk places for contraction. It also serves as a convenient delivery portal so that customers do not have to go all the way to the hospital just to get their prescribed medicine.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/medeliver-screen-physician.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>One of the key features of the app is the ability to converse with physicians, should the customer have some questions regarding their prescription or any new ailments that may pop out as a result of said prescription. Another feature is the ability to see the ratings of physicians, as rated by previous users. It acts as a good gauge to measure the reliability of their feedback and diagnosis.</p>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/medeliver-screen-medicine.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Another key feature is the ease of searching of medicine. Through the user research, there is a general consensus that one might not remember the exact name of the medicine, so these products are all tagged accordingly based on the type of medicine they are.</p>
							<p>The medicine page are further categorised into its descriptions, benefits, directions of use, side effects, and other possible information for easier viewing.</p>
							<h4 class="major">User Research</h4>
							<p>During the research stage, through the user research done on diabetic patients, it was revealed that most of them did not like that they have to queue for long periods of time just to get a prescription at the hospital clinic, without having the need to see a doctor.</p>
